## 🎯 Program Objective

This program is designed to help learners transition from basic academic knowledge of Java to practical backend engineering skills.

By the end of this mentorship, the learner will be able to:

- Write clean, object-oriented Java code
- Apply Collections, Streams, and Exception handling properly
- Understand multithreading fundamentals
- Use essential design patterns in backend systems
- Build REST APIs using Spring Boot
- Persist data using JPA & Hibernate
- Write unit tests using JUnit
- Dockerize and run a backend application

This is not a theoretical course.  
It is a structured, hands-on engineering transformation journey.

## 💡 Mentor’s Note

Backend development is not about memorizing syntax.  
It is about designing systems, thinking logically, and writing maintainable code.

Consistency matters more than speed.  
Understanding matters more than completion.
