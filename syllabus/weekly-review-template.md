This document defines the structured format for conducting weekly mentorship reviews.

Duration: 60–75 minutes  
Frequency: Once per week  
Purpose: Reinforce learning, evaluate progress, and improve engineering thinking.

---

# Review Structure Overview

1. Concept Discussion (15–20 minutes)
2. Code Review (20–25 minutes)
3. Live Problem Solving / Debugging (15–20 minutes)
4. Feedback & Action Plan (10 minutes)

---

# 1. Concept Discussion

Objective: Assess clarity of understanding.

The learner must explain concepts without referring to notes.

## Sample Questions

- Explain encapsulation in your own words.
- Why do we override equals() and hashCode() together?
- What is Dependency Injection?
- What problem does JPA solve?
- What is Lazy Loading?

Focus Areas:
- Clarity
- Logical explanation
- Real-world reasoning
- Confidence

---

# 2. Code Review

Objective: Improve code quality and engineering habits.

Review the weekly assignment or feature branch.

## Review Checklist

### Structure
- Are classes small and focused?
- Is separation of concerns maintained?
- Are responsibilities clearly divided?

### Naming
- Are variable names meaningful?
- Are method names descriptive?
- Are class names domain-oriented?

### Clean Code
- Avoids duplication?
- Methods not too long?
- No unnecessary complexity?
- No commented-out code?

### Exception Handling
- Proper try-catch usage?
- No swallowing exceptions?
- Meaningful error messages?

### Testing (if applicable)
- Unit tests present?
- Edge cases tested?
- Negative scenarios covered?

Encourage discussion rather than one-sided criticism.

# 3. Live Debugging or Problem Solving

Objective: Develop real-time thinking ability.

Options:

## Option A – Debugging
Provide a small broken snippet and ask the learner to:
- Identify the issue
- Explain root cause
- Fix it

## Option B – Logical Problem
Ask to:
- Write a method live
- Refactor a piece of code
- Improve inefficient logic

Observe:
- Thinking process
- Problem breakdown
- Calmness under pressure

---

# 4. Feedback & Action Plan

Objective: Ensure structured improvement.

Discuss:

- What went well this week?
- What was difficult?
- Where did you struggle?
- What needs extra practice?

Provide:

- 1 Strength
- 1 Improvement Area
- 1 Action Item for next week

# Mentor Guidelines

- Be constructive, not critical.
- Focus on improvement, not perfection.
- Encourage independent thinking.
- Allow small mistakes — they accelerate learning.

- Code compiles and runs.
- Quiz attempted.
- Prepared to explain concepts verbally.

Professional preparation builds professional habits.
