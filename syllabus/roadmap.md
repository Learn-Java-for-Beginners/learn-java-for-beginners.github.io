# 8-Week Backend Engineering Roadmap

This roadmap defines the structured transformation from basic Java knowledge to backend application development using Spring Boot and JPA.

The goal is not just learning syntax, but developing engineering thinking, system design clarity, and clean coding habits.

---

# Program Overview

Duration: 8 Weeks  
Expected Effort: 6–10 hours per week  
Format: Self-study + Practical Coding + Weekly Review  

Each week builds on the previous one. Concepts are layered progressively to ensure strong fundamentals before introducing frameworks.

- Synchronization basics
- ExecutorService (introduction)

## Deliverables
- Save application data to file
- Load data on restart
- Simple thread-based feature
- Weekly review discussion

## Outcome
Learner understands basic concurrency risks and can perform file-based persistence.

---

# Week 4 – Design Patterns  and  Clean Architecture

## Objectives
- Introduce structured thinking in software design
- Improve maintainability and readability

## Topics
- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- DTO Pattern
- Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)

## Deliverables
- Refactor previous project using patterns
- Separate responsibilities clearly
- Code review discussion

## Outcome
Learner writes modular and extensible code.

---

# Week 5 – Spring Boot  and  REST APIs

## Objectives
- Transition from core Java to backend framework
- Build production-style REST APIs

## Topics
- Spring Framework basics
- Inversion of Control (IoC)
- Dependency Injection (DI)
- Spring Boot setup
- REST Controllers
- Request/Response handling
- Application configuration

## Deliverables
- Convert existing project to Spring Boot
- Expose CRUD APIs
- Test APIs using Postman

## Outcome
Learner can build and run a REST-based backend service.

---

# Week 6 – JPA  and  Hibernate

## Objectives
- Understand ORM principles
- Integrate application with database

## Topics
- ORM concept
- Entity mapping
- @Id and @GeneratedValue
- JpaRepository
- Relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne)
- Fetch types (Lazy vs Eager)

## Deliverables
- Connect to MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Persist and retrieve entities
- Implement relationships

## Outcome
Learner can integrate backend services with relational databases.

---

# Week 7 – Testing, Validation  and  Logging

## Objectives
- Write reliable and testable code
- Improve production-readiness

## Topics
- JUnit basics
- Writing unit tests
- Assertions
- Mockito basics
- Input validation
- Global exception handling
- Logging fundamentals

## Deliverables
- Write unit tests for services
- Implement global exception handler
- Add input validation

## Outcome
Learner writes testable and maintainable backend code.

---

# Week 8 – Docker  and  Deployment Basics

## Objectives
- Understand containerization
- Prepare application for deployment

## Topics
- Building executable JAR
- Writing Dockerfile
- Docker basics
- docker-compose (app + database)
- High-level Kubernetes overview

## Deliverables
- Dockerized application
- Run using docker-compose
- Demonstrate full workflow

## Outcome
Learner understands how backend applications are packaged and deployed.

---

# Final Outcome

At the end of 8 weeks, the learner should be able to:

- Design clean Java classes
- Implement REST APIs
- Connect to databases
- Handle exceptions properly
- Write unit tests
- Containerize applications
- Think like a backend engineer

This roadmap is designed for progressive, structured transformation — not rushed learning.

Consistency and understanding are more important than speed.
