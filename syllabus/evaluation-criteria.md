This mentorship program follows a structured evaluation model to measure technical growth, engineering thinking, and consistency.

Evaluation is conducted weekly during the review session.

The purpose of evaluation is not grading — it is structured improvement.

---

# Evaluation Philosophy

Assessment is based on:

- Understanding over memorization
- Code clarity over complexity
- Consistency over speed
- Improvement over perfection

Each week the learner will receive feedback in multiple areas.

---

# Scoring Categories

Each category is scored out of 10.

Total possible score per week: 50

---

## 1. Conceptual Understanding (10 Points)

Measures clarity of fundamental concepts.

Evaluation factors:
- Can explain concepts in own words
- Understands "why" behind implementation
- Can differentiate similar concepts
- Handles theoretical questions confidently

Examples:
- Explain difference between abstraction and encapsulation
- Why do we override equals() and hashCode() together?
- What problem does Dependency Injection solve?

---

## 2. Code Quality (10 Points)

Measures cleanliness and structure of implementation.

Evaluation factors:
- Proper naming conventions
- Small, readable methods
- Logical class design
- Avoidance of duplicate code
- Clear separation of concerns

Red flags:
- Long methods (>40 lines)
- Hardcoded values
- Poor indentation
- God classes

---

## 3. Problem-Solving Ability (10 Points)

Measures ability to think logically and independently.

Evaluation factors:
- Breaks down problems clearly
- Handles edge cases
- Avoids unnecessary complexity
- Writes defensive code

Examples:
- Handles null inputs
- Handles empty collections
- Validates user input properly

---

## 4. Testing Mindset (10 Points)

Since this program emphasizes engineering maturity, testing awareness is critical.

Evaluation factors:
- Thinks about edge cases
- Writes unit tests where required
- Covers negative scenarios
- Understands test assertions

Examples:
- Tests invalid input
- Tests boundary conditions
- Tests failure scenarios

---

## 5. Consistency & Effort (10 Points)

Measures discipline and professional growth.

Evaluation factors:
- Completes assignments on time
- Commits regularly to Git
- Improves based on feedback
- Demonstrates preparation for review sessions

Consistency often matters more than raw talent.

# Performance Bands

## 45–50 → Strong Progress
Learner demonstrates confidence and structured thinking.

## 35–44 → Good Progress
Minor improvements required, but solid foundation.

## 25–34 → Developing
Needs reinforcement in fundamentals.

## Below 25 → Intervention Needed
Requires focused support and additional practice.

---

# Growth Tracking

Improvement trend matters more than one week’s score.

Focus areas:
- Is code cleaner than last week?
- Is explanation clearer?
- Are fewer hints required?
- Is testing becoming natural?

---

# Final Evaluation (Week 8)

Final assessment will include:

- Final project code review
- Concept discussion
- Architecture explanation
- Deployment demonstration
- Testing coverage review

Final evaluation will focus on:

- End-to-end understanding
- Professional coding habits
- Backend engineering readiness

---

# Mentor Note

Evaluation is a tool for structured growth.

The goal is not scoring high in Week 1.
The goal is becoming significantly stronger by Week 8.

Continuous improvement is the primary metric of success.
